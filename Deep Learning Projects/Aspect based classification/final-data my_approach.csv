I suggest losing all the decorative candles in the room, add a big colourful ceramic decorative bowl to the sideboard. The place where the floor candles are, leave it empty. Don't do the house plant. You don't need something in every corner of the room. To give this room more style, consider replacing the boring horizontal blinds with something that makes more of a statement. California shutters would be cool. Or side panels (with colour). Also, your dining room is very traditional but the chandelier is modern, it's weird. Look how nice the brass bowl on your table looks with your furniture. I suggest finding a metal chandelier with that same vibe and replacing your current chrome one.

419,There is much one can do. Its as much a matter of  money. ;-) The least impact to the house itself would be to bring the grade up in several terraces using stacking concrete retaining wall block. Try not to have any one wall more than a couple feet high and let the wall layout be free-form. Add interest to the front by pushing out an entry with a gabled end and a covered porch. No need to gut just to reverse the floor plan. provide a space or two in the front for guest parking. I would make each terrace smaller than the one below. The terrace walls could blend into a single high wall on the garage side of the house. With such a home like this often dining/kitchen is pushed/added on at back to create a modern kitchen and to enlarge the living room. If you are finishing out the basement. then two small bedrooms on the main floor can be combine to create a master bedroom suite. New bedrooms below. Windows can be cut in on the exposed foundation. could be a fun project.,"terrace:negative;
